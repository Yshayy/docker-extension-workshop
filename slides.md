# Compose patterns

---

# Sharing a CLI application

- The problem - no web server for CLI apps
- The solution - adding ttyd magic to Compose
- Demo

---

# Sharing a multi-repo application

- The problem - multiple services in different repositories
- The solution - use docker git context in compose
- Demo

---

# Developer tools for debugging in-flight apps
- Demo

---

# From local to remote environments

- Let's not deal with production yet
- Under the hood, Livecycle's Docker extension is using Preevy
- Preevy is an open-source tool for provisioning ephemeral environments
- Demo

---

# Sharing your app across development pipeline

- Local development - docker extension
- Remote environment - preevy
- PR environments - preevy+CI (GH actions, circleCI orb, etc...)
